# live-football-world-cup-score-board library

The `Live Football World Cup Scoreboard` library is designed
to show all the ongoing matches and their scores.

## Usage:
This library provides a ScoreboardManager interface for managing scoreboards in your application.

### Notes/assumptions:
- I add more commits than necessary so you can see my progress and adherence to TDD.
- It's better to create custom exceptions. I use more or less generic one to speed up implementation and simplicity.
- Since models are immutable it's not a problem at the moment. But It's necessary to split input and repo models.
