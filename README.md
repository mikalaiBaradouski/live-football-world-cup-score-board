# live-football-world-cup-score-board library

The `Live Football World Cup Scoreboard` library is designed
to show all the ongoing matches and their scores.

### Notes/assumptions:
- I add more commits than necessary so you can see my progress and adherence to TDD.
- It's better to create custom exceptions. I use more or less generic one to speed up implementation and simplicity.
